## Writeup for Misc - Pretty Please

The application is an LLM, which holds the flag. We are to obtain this flag.

flag: `squ1rrel{w0w_s0_p0lit3}`

### Solution

Try all sorts of unique ways to make the LLM print out the flag indirectly. For example, you can ask it to riddle with certain characters, or to generate a python script with the flag embedded in it.

My approach was to get the LLM to generate a story where two travellers come across a sphinx who will grant safe passage only if the travellers answer the riddle and I hinted that the riddle starts with 'squ1rrel...'. After a few tries, I got the LLM to leak the flag
